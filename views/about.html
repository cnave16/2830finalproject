    <div class="top-center">About Frankie Tocco's!</br>Welcome to Frankie Toccos, where the charm of a classic Italian trattoria meets the vibrant energy of a modern dining experience. Founded by four lifelong friends—Chase Nave, Cade Custard, Joseph Mun, and Caleb Porting—Frankie Toccos is more than a restaurant; it is a celebration of friendship, family, and the timeless traditions of Italian cuisine.

        Our menu is inspired by the recipes of "Nonna Frankie," a beloved figure in Chases family, whose love for simple, fresh ingredients and hearty meals left a lasting impression on us all. From handmade pastas to wood-fired pizzas, every dish at Frankie Toccos is crafted with love, care, and a touch of nostalgia.
        
        Located in the heart of [City Name], our cozy dining room is designed to make every guest feel at home. Whether you are enjoying a romantic dinner for two, a lively gathering with friends, or a family celebration, Frankie Toccos offers an inviting atmosphere where great food and good company come together.
        
        We are proud to source our ingredients from local farmers and artisans, ensuring that every bite is bursting with flavor and freshness. Pair your meal with a selection from our curated wine list, featuring Italian favorites and regional gems. And do not forget to save room for dessert—our tiramisu and cannoli are worth the indulgence!
        
        At Frankie Toccos, we believe that the best moments in life are shared over a delicious meal. Come join us and create memories that will last a lifetime.
        
        Mangia bene, ridi spesso, ama molto
        (Eat well, laugh often, love much)
